# Redirect Server

The "Redirect Server" is a tool that routes various WRI domains to their endpoint. 
The most common usage is for domains that need to point to content within a site:
mydomain.org -> otherdomain.org/somepage
DNS can't be configured to send traffic to the root, so we're redirecting via this tool.

## Confguration
The server consists of an AWS Ubuntu EC2 instance (named "redirect_server') with a EC2 Application Load Balancer 
in front of it (named redirect_service). 

* The load balancer provides auto-renweing security certificates vis AWS ACM
* The EC2 server routes the domains via Apache webserver

To add a new domain:

* Set up a cert with ACM
* Add the domain to the load balancer
* create an Apache conf file on the EC2 instance (/etc/apache2/sites-available)
* restart apache (check syntax first)
  * sudo apachectl configtest (check syntax)
  * sudo service apache2 restart
