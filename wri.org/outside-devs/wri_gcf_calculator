The GCF Calculalor data visualization used as part of the publication:

https://www.wri.org/green-climate-fund-calculators-how-decide-what-each-country-should-contribute

There are 2 versions:

Version 1.0: running from the Uploads directory: https://www.wri.org/upload/gcf-calculator/

Version 2.0: running from the Uploads directory: https://www.wri.org/upload/gcf-calculator-2/ 

The data is stored on the wri.org AWS S3 bucket: https://wriorg.s3.amazonaws.com/upload/gcf-data/Data_Tool_Output.csv

IMPORTANT NOTE: Excel and LibreOffice Calc (and probably every other spreadsheet tool) add a 'new line' to the end of file 
on save/export, which results in an empty row. Remove it from the CSV to prevent the tool from choking: 
Open in a code editor like Sublime and delete the last empty row.
