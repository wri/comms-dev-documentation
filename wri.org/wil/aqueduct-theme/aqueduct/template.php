 * Include template function files.
 *
 * Template functions are grouped into files loosely based on hooks, in the
 * hopes that functions addresssing similar concerns are easy to track. For
 * instance, template functions dealing with fields are likely grouped into
 * field.inc. The reason this isn't broken down further is because there isn't
 * yet an incentive to break functions out into even more files.
