Password Policy for Drupal/WordPress User Accounts
--------------------------------------------------

Best Practice for Strong Passwords:

1. Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
2. Our guideline is 20 character minimum
3. Don't reuse passwords between accounts

Generating a Strong Password:

WRI Institutional sites built in Drupal will:

1. Assess your password strength whenever you create one for your user account
2. Create an optional strong password for you to use
3. Won't accept anything other than a strong password

Password Managers

You can use reputable password generation tools like LastPass password generator https://www.lastpass.com/features/password-generator#generatorTool. Remember to set the character count to 20.

Use a password manager for all of your passwords: Bitwarden (free), 1Password, Dashlane, Proton Pass. You can also use your OS, Browser, or phone password manager.
