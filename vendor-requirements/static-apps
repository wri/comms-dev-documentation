# Static HTML

## Example from Static Pages built for Ocean by Cast from Clay

Delivery: as a code commit to the repo. I will create a branch with a "multidev" instance on Pantheon and share access.

Testing: multiplatform ting using Browserstack or similar tools. 
Final code test should be on the Pantheon "multidev" instance to ensure full compatibility with our production environment. 
WRI will merge to master and make all deployments.Â 

Requirements: static files with no server dependencies. All code needs to be compiled to run as js. 
External libraries to be pulled in via cdn. 
Essentially, the pages need to be flat files that could run locally in any browser.

Browser compatibility: modern browsers across platforms (Chrome, FF, Safari, Edge)

Design: files should include a header and footer to match the main site, and share design elements to match to the main site. Pages should be fully responsive with an effective mobile UX.
