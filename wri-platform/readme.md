## WRI Platform

Technical documentation for the WRI Platform. 

The "WRI Platform" consists of a shared profile used across individual sites: https://github.com/wri/wri_sites

We use CircleCI and Pantheon Build Tools to automate deployments, triggered by merges to the main branch repository of each site. Documentation: https://github.com/wri/wriflagship/wiki 

New sites are generated using the Starter Kit: https://github.com/wri/wri-starter-kit
